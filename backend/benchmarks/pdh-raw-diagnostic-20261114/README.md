# Raw/formatted PDH failure diagnostic

This independent observer retains raw values and formatted-value bit patterns
from the same PDH query after each collection. It stops on a collection or
formatted-array API failure, retaining both API call statuses and the raw array
from that collection when available. It does not convert raw counters to rates,
repair invalid samples, attribute System/PID 4 activity, or accept performance.
The benchmark collector and coverage rules are unchanged.

Run from the engineering checkout:

    python backend/benchmarks/pdh-raw-diagnostic-20261114/capture.py --samples 900 --label UNIQUE

The output directory must not exist. Each sample is flushed. The final manifest
records source/log hashes and input immutability. The initial SanitizerA run is
an observer diagnostic during the active Q6 full-model sanitizer, not a clean
inference timing workload. It starts no competing GPU kernel or application.
Raw provider failures remain explicit in the log even when formatting succeeds.

`abi.c` checks the Windows header layout against the Python ctypes declarations.
GCC C17 O3 strict-warning compilation and the comparison passed: raw structure
size 40, timestamp/first/second/multi offsets 4/16/24/32, array item size 48,
raw-value offset 8. `abi.json` retains the checked source and executable hashes.
The first compiler invocation lacked the toolchain bin directory in PATH and
failed to find the assembler; adding that directory resolved the build.

Original diagnostic code based on documented APIs and structures, not copied

The two-call sizing pattern is used, with bounded re-sizing on MORE_DATA.
The diagnostic does not read failed array buffers as valid measurements.

`analyze.py COMPLETED_FOLDER TARGET_LUID` verifies a completed capture's hashes
and sample inventory before retaining raw-delta/formatted agreement, out-of-range
values, instance churn and API/status failures. It refuses live/incomplete logs.
Four manual CPU checks covered a 150% raw/format match, invalid status exclusion,
API failure with disappearing instance, and malformed adapter identity. Its
incomplete-capture refusal was also exercised. Agreement alone is not acceptance.
